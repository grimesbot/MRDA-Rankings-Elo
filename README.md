MRDA Rankings Algorithm using Elo Rating
===============
## [Unoffical MRDA Rankings Elo Algorithm Tool](https://grimesbot.github.io/MRDA-Rankings-Elo)

Summary
---------------
This repository calculates **unofficial** rankings for the [MRDA](https://mrda.org/) using an [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to calculate the relative strengths of each team.

This is used along side a [Game Point Average Algorithm](https://github.com/grimesbot/MRDA-Rankings-GPA) to aid the MRDA Rankings Panel in making informed and prompt decisions. Both have been supplanted by weighted least squares rating systems: [Linear Regression Algorithm using Score Ratios](https://github.com/grimesbot/MRDA-Rankings-LRR) and [Linear Regression Algorithm using Score Differentials](https://github.com/grimesbot/MRDA-Rankings-LRD)

The logic is based on [ForceANature110](https://github.com/ForceANature110)'s [MRDARankingsELO](https://github.com/ForceANature110/MRDARankingsELO) repository with configuration and rough user interface enhancements from [MRDA-Rankings-GPA](https://github.com/grimesbot/MRDA-Rankings-GPA). Thank you to both [ForceANature110](https://github.com/ForceANature110) and [mbd1x1y](https://github.com/mbd1x1y) for their work on these algorithms and their feedback, consultation and collaboration on these tools.

Disclaimer
---------------
This algorithm is not final and this is NOT an official source of MRDA Rankings. Per MRDA's Policies and Procedures, "Rankings will be determined by a Rankings Panel," and this algorithm is a tool to help the five members of the Rankings Panel make informed and prompt decisions. Any algorithm has limitations and the Rankings Panel will use their experience and judgement to take into account those limitations and the human elements of the sport. This tool and it's source code are publicly available for transparency and informational purposes, use with discretion.
